### Jazmin Richards

## About 
Hi I'm Jazmin. _Welcome to my page_ 👋 

After studying Business Studies at Sixth Form I was very keen to become Self-Employed. I found the freedom of working for yourself very empowering and motivating. I am always fully invested in any project I have, and occasionally work with others to complete these projects. Having recently had a child, that has given me the push to become qualified in a profession but also to enjoy my work. In the past I have worked with companies who design till systems. I found this very interesting as the whole company was based around coding. I am very passionate about learning and will commit myself fully to all my projects. 

## Projects
👩‍💻I am currently working on HTML, CSS & Javascript.

As time goes by my skill set is upgrading and I find (at the moment) the Front End Developing very fascinating.
